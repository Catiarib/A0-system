# A·0 Demo: Pilot Experience - Barcelona 2026

This demo showcases how the **A·0 System** transforms a traditional immersive experience into an intelligent, data-driven infrastructure.

## 🎬 The Scene: "Narrative Light" Pilot
**Location:** Disseny Hub Barcelona (DHUB)
**Objective:** Luxury Brand Launch (Adaptive Experience)

---

### Step 1: The Modular Build (Engine)
A·0 isn't built from scratch. We deploy the **Modular Engine**.

| Visual | Module | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Deploying-blue) | **M01 + M02** | The Narrative Core synchronizes with Dynamic Light Design. |
| ![Interaction](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-green) | **M06 + M08** | Sensors are placed at entry/exit points to capture flow. |

> **What happens:** As the visitor walks in, the light doesn't just "turn on"—it *adapts* to their pace using the **M06 Interaction Module**.

---

### Step 2: Real-Time Adaptation (The "Video" Script)
*Imagine a video showing the following sequence:*

1.  **0:00 - 0:10:** A visitor enters a dark corridor. The **A·0 Data Layer** detects presence.
2.  **0:10 - 0:20:** The **M04 Motion Module** triggers a generative visual that follows the visitor's silhouette on the wall.
3.  **0:20 - 0:30:** The visitor stops at the "Hero Product." The **M08 Data Capture** logs a "High Engagement Event" (Dwell time > 15s).
4.  **0:30 - 0:40:** The light intensity (M02) increases to highlight the product automatically based on the engagement data.

---

### Step 3: From Light to Data (Data Layer)
While the visitor sees art, A·0 sees **structured data**.

```python
# A·0 Data Layer Snippet: Capturing Engagement
{
  "event": "engagement_high",
  "zone": "M03_Space_Layout_Core",
  "dwell_time": "42s",
  "emotional_score": 0.89,
  "module_sync": ["M02", "M04", "M05"]
}
```

---

### Step 4: The Output (Analytics Dashboard)
At the end of the day, the brand receives the **A·0 Analytics Report**.

*   **KPI 1:** Average dwell time at product: **48 seconds** (Target: 30s).
*   **KPI 2:** Correlation between Light Intensity and Sales Leads: **+15%**.
*   **KPI 3:** Visitor Flow Efficiency: **92%** (No bottlenecks detected via M03).

## 🚀 Why A·0 Wins
1.  **Replicable:** This exact setup can be deployed in Madrid next week using the **M10 Replication Protocol**.
2.  **Measurable:** The brand knows exactly *why* the experience worked.
3.  **Intelligent:** The system learns that "Scenario B" (Warmer lights) leads to longer dwell times.

### Pilot Infrastructure (BCN 2026)
- **Infrastructure:** A·0 Core v0.1
- **Hardware:** LiDAR Sensors + DMX Lighting Controllers
- **Data Stack:** Python ETL + SQL Server + Power BI
