# A·0 — Operating System for Adaptive Visual Experiences

## What is A·0

A·0 is the first operating system for adaptive visual experiences. It is not a creative studio. It is not an events agency. **It is infrastructure.**

A modular, reusable engine with an integrated Data Layer that converts every immersive experience into actionable data.

```
Art + System + Data = A·0
```

---

## The Problem It Solves

The immersive experience market has two structural fractures:

**1. Artistic but not systematic**
Studios create unique, beautiful experiences — but they cannot be replicated, scaled, or measured. Every project starts from zero.

**2. Spectacular but not intelligent**
Projection mapping, spatial audio, interactive lighting — these generate zero usable data. The audience experiences something extraordinary, but the brand learns nothing.

> A·0 is the missing infrastructure between art and data.

## How It Works

A·0 operates through three integrated layers:

### Layer 1 — Engine (Modular System)
10 reusable blocks that can be combined to build any visual experience:

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| M01 · Narrative Core | Story structure and concept architecture |
| M02 · Light Design | Dynamic lighting and spatial atmosphere |
| M03 · Space Layout | Spatial distribution and visitor flow |
| M04 · Motion & Media | Video mapping and generative media |
| M05 · Sound Design | Spatial audio and soundscape |
| M06 · Interaction | Sensors, triggers, and real-time response |
| M07 · Brand Integration | Visual identity and brand coherence |
| M08 · Data Capture | Sensors, cameras, tracking systems |
| M09 · Analytics Dashboard | Power BI reports and KPIs |
| M10 · Replication Protocol | Deployment in new locations or editions |

### Layer 2 — Data Layer
Every experience generates structured data:
- Visitor flow and dwell time
- Emotional engagement by zone
- Content performance metrics
- ROI and brand impact indicators

Stack: `Python` · `SQL` · `Power BI` · `REST APIs`

### Layer 3 — System Book
Complete operational documentation for each project:
- Technical architecture
- Replication protocols
- Data schemas
- Financial model
